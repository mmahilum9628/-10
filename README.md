This was a prject for my computer programming class concerning Python with Turtle. This design is mostly brightly colored in multiple shades of orange or yellow. The most difficult challenge I faced while writing the code was to get the turtle to draw exactly what I wanted. After a few attempts I settled with a flower like design overlapping a intricate weave of orange tendrils. I promptly gave up.
